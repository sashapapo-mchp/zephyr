	  Allow I2C target drivers to expose both a primary and secondary address.
	  When enabled, target drivers may update i2c_target_config.secondary_address
	  and i2c_target_config.target_address to reflect the addresses currently in
	  use.  Disable this to reduce structure size when dual-address targets are
	  never used.
